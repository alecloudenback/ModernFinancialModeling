# Other Useful Techniques

## In this chapter

Other useful techniques are surveyed, such as: memoization to avoid repeated computations, psuedo-monte carlo, creating a model office, and tips on modeling a complete balance sheet. Also covered are elements of practical review such as static and dynamic validations, and implied rate analysis.

## Conceptual Techniques

### Taking things to the Extreme

Consider what happens if something is taken to an extreme. For example, what happens in the model if we input negative rates? Where should negative rates be allowed and can the model handle them?

### Range Bounding

Sometimes you just need to know that an outcome is within a certain range - if you can develop a "high" and "low" estimate by making assumptions that you know are outside of feasible ranges, then you can determine whether something is reasonable or within tolerances.

To take an example from the pages of interview questions: say you need to determine if a mortgaged property's value is greater than the amount of the outstanding loan (say \$100,000). You don't have an appraisal, but know that it's in reasonable condition and that (1) a comparable house with many more issues sold for \$100 per square foot. You also don't know the square footage of the house, but know from the number of rooms and layout that it must be at least 1000 square feet. Therefore you know that the value should at least be greater than:

$$
\frac{\$100}{\text{sq. ft}} \times 1000 \text{sq. ft} = \$100,000 
$$

We'd then conclude that the value of the house very likely exceeds the outstanding balance of the loan and resolves our query without complex modeling or expensive appraisals.
