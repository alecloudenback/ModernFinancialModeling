## In this section

Fundamentals of parallel workloads, different mechanisms to distribute work: vectorization, multi-threading, GPU, and multi-device workflows. Different programming models: map-reduce, arrays, and tasks.

## Amdahl's Law and the Limits of Parallel Computing

An important ground-truth in computing is that there is an upper limit to how fast a workload can be sped up through distributing the workload among multiple processor units. For example, if there is a modeling workload wherein 90% of the work is independent (say policy or asset level calculations) and the remaining 10% of the workload is an aggregate (say company or portfolio level), then the theoretical maximum speedup of the process is 10x faster (1 / 90% parallelizable load). This is captured in a law known as **Amdahl's Law** and it reflects the *theoretical* maximum speedup a workload could see. In practice, the speedup is worse than this due to overhead of moving data around, scheduling the tasks, and aggregating results. This is why in many cases a good effort in sequential workloads (see \@#sec-performance-single) is often a more fruitful effort than trying to parallelize some workloads.

That said, there are still many modeling use-cases for parallelization. Modern investment and insurance portfolios can easily contain 100's of thousands or millions of seriatim holdings. In many cases, these can be evaluated independently, though on the often times there is interaction with the total portfolio (contract dividends, non-guaranteed elements, profit sharing, etc.). Further, even if the holdings are not parallelizable across the holdings dimension, we are often interested in independent evaluations across economic scenarios which is amendable to parallelization. $$
S(n) = \frac{1}{(1-p) + \frac{p}{n}}
$$

Where:

-   $S(n)$ is the theoretical speedup of the execution of the whole task
-   $n$ is the number of processors
-   $p$ is the proportion of the execution time that benefits from improved resources

We can visualize this for different combinations of $p$ and $n$ in @fig-amdahl.

```{julia}
#| label: fig-amdahl
#| fig-cap: "Theoretical upper bound for speedup of a workload given the parallelizable portion $p$ and number of processors $n$."
using CairoMakie

function amdahl_speedup(p, n)
    return 1 / ((1 - p) + p / n)
end

function main()
    fig = Figure(size=(800, 600))
    ax = Axis(fig[1, 1],
        title="Amdahl's Law",
        xlabel=L"Number of processors ($n$)",
        ylabel="Speedup",
        xscale=log2,
        xticks=2 .^ (0:16),
        xtickformat=x -> "2^" .* string.(Int.(log.(2, x))),
        yticks=0:2:20
    )

    n = 2 .^ (0:16)
    parallel_portions = [0.5, 0.75, 0.9, 0.95]
    linestyles = [:solid, :dash, :dashdot, :solid]

    for (i, p) in enumerate(parallel_portions)
        speedup = [amdahl_speedup(p, ni) for ni in n]
        lines!(ax, n, speedup, label="$(Int(p*100))%", linestyle=linestyles[i])
    end

    xlims!(ax, 1, 2^16)
    ylims!(ax, 0, 20)

    axislegend(ax, L"Parallel portion ($p$)", position=:lt)
    fig
end

main()
```

With this understanding, we will be able to set expectations and analyze the benefit of parallelization.

## Types of Parallelism

Parallel processing comes in different flavors and is related to the details of hardware as discussed in @sec-hardware. We will necessarily extend the discussion of hardware here, as parallelization is (mostly) inextricably tied to hardware details (we will revisit this in @sec-parallel-programming-models).

| Type | Description | Strengths | Weaknesses |
|------------------|-------------------|------------------|------------------|
| Vectorization (SIMD) | Performs same operation on multiple data points simultaneously | Efficient for data-parallel tasks, uses specialized CPU instructions | Limited to certain types of operations, data must be contiguous |
| Multi-Threading | Executes multiple threads concurrently on a single CPU | Good for task parallelism, utilizes multi-core processors effectively | Overhead from thread management, potential race conditions |
| GPU | Uses graphics processing units (GPUs) for parallel computations | Excellent for massively parallel tasks, high throughput | Specialized programming required, data transfer overhead |
| Multi-Device / Distributed | Spreads computation across multiple machines or devices | Scales to very large problems, can use heterogeneous hardware | Complex to implement and manage, network latency issues |

: Major types of computational parallelism highlighting their key characteristics, advantages, and potential drawbacks.

## Vectorization {#sec-vectorization}

**Vectorization** in the context of parallel processing refers to special circuits within the CPU wherein the CPU will load multiple data units (e.g. 4 or 8 floating point numbers) in a contiguous block and perform the same instruction on them at the same time. This is also known as **SIMD, or Single-Instruction Multiple Data**.

The requirements for SIMD-able code are that:

-   The intended section for SIMD is inside the inner-most loop.
-   There are no branches (if-statements) inside the loop body.
    -   Indexing an array is actually a possible branch, as two cases could arise: the index is inbounds or out-of-bounds. To avoid this, either use `for x in collection`, `for i in eachindex(collection)` or `for i in 1:n; @inbounds collection[i]` though the last of these is discouraged in favor of ther prior, safer options.
-   

```{julia}
using BenchmarkTools

function prevent_simd(arr)
    sum = 0
    for x in arr
        if x > 0
            sum += x
        end
    end
    return sum
end

function allow_simd(arr)
    sum = 0
    for x in arr
        sum += max(x, 0)
    end
    return sum
end

let
    x = rand(10000)

    @btime prevent_simd($x)
    @btime allow_simd($x)
end
```

In testing the above code, the `allow_simd` version should be several times faster than the `prevent_simd` example. The reason is that `prevent_simd` has a branch (`if x > 0`) where the behavior of the code may change depending on the value in `arr`. Conversely, the behavior of `allow_simd` is always the same in each iteration, no matter the value of `x`. This allows the compiler to generate vectorized code automatically.

Note that the compiler is able to identify vectorizable code in many cases, though through some cases may benefit from a more manual hint to the compiler through macro annotations (see `?@simd` for details).

Other types of parallelism that we will discuss in this chapter have some risk of errors or data corruption if not used correctly. SIMD isn't prone to issues like this because if the code is not SIMD-able then the compiler will not auto-vectorize the code block.

### Hardware

Vectorization is hardware dependent. If the CPU does not support vectorization you will not see speedups from it. Many consumer and professional chips have AVX2 (Advanced Vector Extensions, with the 2 signifying second-generation 256 bit width, allowing four simultaneous 64-bit operations). The next generation is AVX512, having twice the SIMD capacity as AVX2. However, as of 2025 most consumer chips do not yet have that and commercial chips may not actually be faster than the AVX2 due to thermal restrictions (SIMD uses more power and generates more heat).

### Additional Packages

Some additional packages to be aware of include:

-   [LoopVectorization.jl](https://github.com/JuliaSIMD/LoopVectorization.jl) which can enhance the vectorized loops even further, such as handling the "tail" of a vectorized loops more efficiently than the base compiler. The "tail" refers to situations like where you have a vector width of 8, but don't have a collection that's a nice multiple of 8 (say 1001 elements).
-   [Octavian.jl](https://github.com/JuliaLinearAlgebra/Octavian.jl) implements a linear algebra-like library, utilizing parallelism via vectorization to generate efficent code for the system it's running on.
-   [Tulio.jl](https://github.com/mcabbott/Tullio.jl) is an einsum library, a domain-specific language for tensor (a specific subset of vectors) operations, common in machine learning and linear algebra.

## Multi-Threading {#sec-multithreading}

### Tasks {#sec-tasks}

To understand mulithreading examples, we first need to discuss **Tasks**, which are chunks of computation that get performed together, but after which the computer is free to switch to a new task. Technically, there are some instructions within a task that will let the computer pause and come back to that task later (such as `sleep`). Tasks are do not, by themselves, allow for multiple computations to be performed in parallel. For example, one task might be loading a data file from persistent storage into RAM. After that task is complete, the computer continues on with another task in the queue (rendering a web page, playing a song, etc.). In this way even with a single processor and core, a computer could be "doing multiple things at once" (or "multi-tasking") even though nothing is running in parallel. The scheduling of the tasks is handled automatically by Julia and the operating system.

Here's an example of a couple of tasks where we write to an array. The second task actually writes to the array first, since we asked the first task to sleep (which allows the computer to yield to other tasks in the queue)[^parallelization-1].

[^parallelization-1]: Technically, it's possible that the second task doesn't write to the array first. This could happen if there's enough tasks (from our program or others on the computer) that saturate the CPU during the first task's `sleep` period such that the first task gets picked up again before the second one does.

```{julia}
let
   shared_array = zeros(5)

   task1 = @task begin
        sleep(1)
       shared_array[1] = 1

       println("Task 1: ", shared_array)
   end

   task2 = @task begin
       shared_array[2] = 2
       println("Task 2: ", shared_array)
   end

   schedule(task1); schedule(task2)
   wait(task1)
   wait(task2)

   println("Main: ", shared_array)
end
```

#### Channels {#sec-channels}

**Channels** are a way to communicate data in an ordered way between tasks. You specify a type of data that the buffer will contain and how many elements it can hold. It then stores items (via `put!`) in a first-in-first-out (FIFO) queue, which can be popped off the queue (via \`take!) by other tasks.

Here's an example of a system which generates trades in the financial markets at random time intervals, and a monitoring tasks takes the results and tabulates running statistics:

```{julia}
let

    function trade_producer(channel,i)
            sleep(rand())  # <1> 
            profit = randn()   #<2>
            put!(channel, profit)
            println("Producer: Trade Result #$i $(round(profit, digits=3))")
    end
    
    function portfolio_monitor(channel,n)
        sum = 0.0
        for _ in 1:n # <3>
            profit = take!(channel)
            sum += profit
            println("Monitor: Received $(round(profit, digits=3)), Cumulative profit: $(round(sum, digits=3))")
        end
    end

    channel = Channel{Float64}(32)  # <4> 
    
    # Start producer and consumer tasks
    @sync begin # <5>
        for i in 1:5; @async trade_producer(channel,i); end  # <6>
        @async portfolio_monitor(channel,5) # <6>
    end
    
    
    # Close the channel and wait for tasks to finish
    close(channel)
end

```

1.  Random sleep between 0 and 1 seconds
2.  Generate a random number from standard normal distribution to simulate profit or loss from a trade
3.  In this teaching example, we've limited the system to produce just five "trades". In practice, this could be kept running indefinitely via, e.g., `while true`.
4.  Create a channel with a buffer size of 32 floats (in this limited example, we could have gotten away with just 5 since that's how many the demonstration produces). In practice, you want this to be long enough that the consumer of the channel never gets so far behind that the channel fills up. The channel is created outside of the `@sync` block so that `channel` is in scope when we `close` it.
5.  `@sync` waits (like `wait(task)`) for all of the scheduled tasks within the block to complete before proceeding with the rest of the program.
6.  `@async` does the combination of creating a task via `@task` and `schedule`-ing in one, simpler call.

This is really useful for handling events that are "external" to our program. If we were just doing a modelign excersise using static data, then we could control the order of processing and not need to worry about monitoring a volatile source of data. Nonetheless, tasks can still be useful in some cases even if a model is not using "live" data: for example if one of the steps in a model is to load a very large dataset, it may be possible to perform some computations while chunked task requests are queued to load more data from the disk.

while Julia's garbage collector will eventually clean up unclosed channels, it's a good practice to explicitly `close` them to ensure proper resource management, clear signaling of completion, and to avoid potential blocking or termination issues in your programs.

An additional thing to be aware of: if the task never finishes properly inside the `@sync`, then your program may get stuck in an infite loop and hang. Such as if one of the tasks never has a termination conidtion such as an upper bound on a loop, or a clear way to `break` out of a `while true` loop. While not different than a normal loop, such issues become less obvious underneath the layer of task abstractions.

The key takeaway for tasks is that it's a way to chunk work into bundles that can be run in a concurrent fashion, even if nothing is technically being processed in parallel. The multi-threading and parallel programming paradigms sections build off of tasks so an understanding of tasks is helpful. However, some of the higher level libraries hide the task-based building blocks from you as the user/developer and so an intricate understanding of tasks is not required to be successful in parallelizing your Julia code.

### Multi-Threading Overview

When a program starts on your computer, a **process** is created which is where the operating system allocates some overhead items (keeping track of the the code and memory allocations and layout) and block of memory in RAM that can be utilized by that process. Different processes do not have access to each other's allocated memory.

::: callout-note
Readers may be familar with starting Excel in different processes. When Microsoft Excel is opened multiple times, in different processes, then the workbooks in each respective process do not share memory and cannot create links or use full copy/paste functionality between them. It's only when workbooks are opened within the same process that the workbooks may seamslessley talk to each other.
:::

Within each process, a main thread is created. That thread is where the running of the code occurs. For the level of the discussion here, you can mainly think of a process as a container with shared memory for threads, which do the real work (as illustrated in @fig-process-threads). Besides the main thread, other threads can be created within the process and access the same shared memory.

```{dot}
//| label: fig-process-threads
//| fig-cap: "When a program starts, the operating system creates a process for which multiple threads (a *main* thread plus optional additional threads) share memory."

digraph G {
    compound=true;
    node [shape=box];
    
    subgraph cluster_0 {
        label = "Operating System";
        
        subgraph cluster_1 {
            label = "Process ABC";
            A [label="thread 1"];
        }
        
        subgraph cluster_2 {
            label = "process XYZ";
            B [label="thread 1"];
            C [label="thread 2"];
        }
    }
}
```

The advantage of threads is that within a single physical processor, there may be multiple cores. Those cores can access the shared process memory and run tasks from different threads simultaneously. This is a technique that takes advantage of modern processor architecture wherein several (sometimes as many as 32 or more) cores exist on the same chip.

::: callout-note
Technically, there are different flavors of threading. While not critical for the understanding and modeling-focused dicsussion here, for completeness here is a bit more detail on different thread types.

-   Recall that **Tasks** are chunks of computation that get performed together, but after which the computer is free to switch to a new task. For example, one task might be loading a data file from persistent storage into RAM. After that task is complete, the computer continues on with another task in the queue (rendering a web page, playing a song, etc.). In this way even with a single processor and core, a computer could be "doing multiple things at once" (or "multi-tasking") even though nothing is running in parallel.
-   **Operating System Threads** or just **Threads** are managed (as the name implies) at the operating system level. The benefit to this is that operating system level threads have more power: the operating system can pause or limit throughput on running programs if the operating system needs the resources for something it deems higher priority. It's technically possible to use this power to force a higher priority for your own code, but Julia and many other languages do not offer creating of these types of threads in favor of the next type of threads. Operating system threads have a higher amount overhead (time and memory) involved in creating and destroying the threads.
-   **Green threads**, **cooperative threads**, **fibers**, or **user-threads** are the type of threads that Julia provides. They are managed at the process (Julia) level and don't have as much overhead in their creation as operating system threads. Also in Julia, a thread is implemented via Tasks

Parallelism in modern computing comes in many flavors, occurs at many different levels (hardward, OS, software, network), and has many different implementations of similar concepts. The terminology of threading in practice and online documentation is confusing and prone to confusion. If you are having a discussion or asking a question, feel free to take the time to ask for clarification on the terminology being used at a given point in time.
:::

::: callout-important
To use multi-threading, Julia needs to be started with more than one thread. This can be done by either setting the environment variable `JULIA_NUM_THREADS` to either `auto` or specify a number like `4`. You can also specify how many threads to start julia with if given the `-t` command line argument (such as running `julia -t 4` to start Julia with four threads from the command line). For the examples in this book and how many threads are used, see @sec-colophon for the system settings.

Why doesn't it automatically start with more than one thread? Between "hyperthreading" (synthetic additional thread capacity), multi-core architectures, and the different types of threads it's actually difficult to predict how many threads will be optimal for a given system. Julia's current default is to take the more conservative approach and start single-threaded unless otherwise specified. The "auto" option is a best-guess but can, on certain systems and configurations, be very bad for performance. The authors recommend for most common systems to just use "auto".
:::

#### Multi-Threading Pitfalls

Different threads being able to access the same memory is a double-edged sword. It is useful because we do not need to create multiple copies of the data in RAM or in the cache[^parallelization-2] and can improve the overall throughput of our usually memory-bandwidth-limited machines. The downside is that if we are mutating the shared data for which our program relies upon, then our program may produce unintended results if the modification occurs carelessly. There are a couple of related issues to be aware of:

[^parallelization-2]: There are some chips which do not have access to the same memory in a multi-threading context, and are known as non-uniform memory access (NUMA). These architectures work more like those in @sec-multi-device.

##### Race Conditions

The first issue is known as a **race condition**, which occurs when a block of memory has been read from or written to in an unintended order. For example, if we have two threads which are accumulating a sub-total, each process may read the running sub-total before the other thread has finished it's update.

In the following example, we use the `Threads.@threads` to tell Julia to automatically distribute the work across threads.

```{julia}

function sum_bad(n)
    subtotal = 0
    Threads.@threads for i in 1:n
        subtotal += i
    end
    subtotal
end

sum_bad(100_000)
```

The result of this should be that `subtotal` doesn't equal `5000050000` because the different threads pick up the subtotal before the other thread finishes adding it's current value. As a result, when one of the threads finishes it's work another may be starting from a place that ignores the updated value.

#### Avoiding Multi-threading Pitfalls

We will cover several ways to manage multi-threading race conditions, but it is the recommendation of the authors to primarily utilize higher level library code, which will be demonstrated after covering some of the more basic, manual techniques.

##### Chunking up work into single-threaded work

In this example, we can correct `sum_bad` by splitting the work into different threads, each of which is independent. Then, we can aggregate the results of each of the chunks.

```{julia}
function sum_single(a)
    s = 0
    for i in a
        s += i
    end
    s
end
@btime sum_single(1:100_000)
```

Note that in the single-threaded case, Julia is able to identify this common pattern and use a shortcut, calculating the sum of the integers $1$ through $n$ as $\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$.

```{julia}
function sum_chunker(a)

chunks = Iterators.partition(1:a, a ÷ Threads.nthreads())
           tasks = map(chunks) do chunk
               Threads.@spawn sum_single(chunk)
           end
           chunk_sums = fetch.(tasks)
           return sum_single(chunk_sums)

end

@btime sum_chunker(100_000)
```

##### Using Locks

**Locks** prevent memory from being accessed from more than one thread at a time.

```{julia}
function sum_with_lock(n)
    subtotal = 0
    lock = ReentrantLock()
    Threads.@threads for i in 1:n
        Base.@lock lock begin
            subtotal += i
        end
    end
    subtotal
end
@btime sum_with_lock(100_000)
```

##### Using Atomics

**Atomics** are certain primitive values with a reduced set of operations for which Julia and the compiler can automatically create thread-safe code. This is often significantly faster than the context-switching overhead needed with locking and unlocking memory for threaded tasks. Compared with locks, atomics are simpler to implement and easier to reason about. The downside is that atomics are limited to the available primitive atomics types and methods.

```{julia}
function sum_with_atomic(n)
    subtotal = Threads.Atomic{Int}(0)
    Threads.@threads for i in 1:n
        Threads.atomic_add!(subtotal, i)
    end
    subtotal[]
end

@btime sum_with_atomic(100_000)
```

## GPU and TPUs {#sec-GPUs}

### Hardware

Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) and Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) are hardware accellerators for massively parallel computations. A TPU is very similar to a GPU but have special ability to handle data types and instructions that are more specialized for linear algebra operations; going forward we will simply refer to these types of accellerators as GPUs.

GPUs have similar components as the CPU as discussed in @sec-hardware. They have RAM, caches for the cores, and cores that run the coded instructions on the data. The differences from a CPU are primarily:

-   A GPU typically has thousands of cores while a CPU generally has single or double digit cores.
    -   The cores typically operate at a *slower* clock speed than CPUs, relying on the sheer number of cores to perform computations faster.
-   The GPU cores essentially have to be running the same set of instructions on all of the data, not unlike vectorization (@sec-vectorization).
    -   GPU code is not suited for code with branching conditions (e.g. `if` statements) and so is more limited in the kinds of computations it can handle compared to the CPU.
-   The RAM is typically much more constrained, typically less than a quarter of what primary RAM might be.
    -   As a result, GPUs may need strategies to move chunks of data to and from the GPU memory for moderately large datasets. Further, it's actually fairly common to use a lower-precision datatype (e.g. `Float16` or `Float32`) to improve overall program throughput at the cost of some precision.
-   The caches are similar in concept to CPU, but unlike most CPU caches, the there is locality to data wherein core #1 will have much quicker access to a different subset of data than, say, core #1024.
-   A GPU is usually a secondary device of sorts: it physically and in device architecture is separate from the CPU which remains in charge of overal computer execution. To some extent, this is changing with some of the latest computer hardware. For example, the M-series of Apple processors have the CPU, GPU, and RAM in a single tightly integrated package for efficiency and computational power.
    -   The implication of this (as with any movement of memory) is that there is overhead to moving data to and from the GPU. Your calculations will need to be in the singlke milliseconds range of time in order to start to see benefit from utilizing a GPU.

#### Notable Vendors and Libraries

Like the difference between x86 and ARM architectures, GPU also have specific architectures which vary by the vendor. To make full use of the hardware, the vendors need to (1) provide device drivers which allow the CPU to talk to the GPU, and (2) provide the libraries (lower level application programming interfaces, or APIs) which allow developers to utilize different hardware features without needing to write machine code. As of the mid 2020s, here are the most important GPU vendors and the associated programming library for utilizing their specific hardware:

| Vendor | Hardware | API Library/Package |
|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| NVIDIA | Geforce, GTX/RTX, various Data Center focused hardware | CUDA |
| AMD | Radeon, various Data Center focused hardware | ROCm |
| Intel | Core, Xeon, Arc processors | OneAPI |
| Apple | M Series processors | Metal |
| Google | Tensor processors | TensorFlow |

: Important GPU and TPU vendors and the associated library/interface.

### Utilizing a GPU

With some of the key conceptual differences between CPUs and GPUs explained, let's explore how to incorporate these powerful hardware accelerators.

#### Julia GPU Libraries

There's essentially two types of GPU programming we will discuss here:

1.  Array-based programming can, in Julia, be fairly easily translated into code that will run on GPUs.
2.  Generated kernels wherein higher level Julia code is written but is compiled into GPU-compatible code.

::: callout-note
**Kernels** is a term used to describe explicit instructions for operating on data, as opposed to general code where the compiler can translate higher level functions into explicit instructions.
:::

It is possible to explicitly write a GPU kernel in Julia or vendor API library (CUDA, Metal, etc.) but this is more advanced usage which will not be covered here.

Julia has wonderful support for several of the primary vendors (at the time of writing, CUDA, Metal, OneAPI, and ROCm) via the [JuliaGPU organization](https://juliagpu.org). Installation of the required dependencies is also very straightforward and the interfaces at the array and generated kernel levels are very similar. The differences are obvious at the lower level vendor-API wrappers (which is the lower-level technique that will not be covered here).

The benefit of the consistency of the higher level libraries we will use here is that examples written for one of the types of accelerators will be largely directly translate-able to another. This is especially true for array programming, a little less so for the kernel style, and the least true for for the low level vendor-API wrapper functionality.

This book will be rendered on a Mac and therefore the examples will use Metal in order to run computational cells, however we'll show a CUDA translation for some of the examples in order to show the straight-forward nature of translating higher level GPU code in Julia is.

| GPU API | GPU Array Type | Kernel Macro |
|---------|----------------|--------------|
| CUDA    | `CuArray`      | `@cuda`      |
| Metal   | `MtlArray`     | `@metal`     |
| oneAPI  | `oneArray`     | `@oneAPI`    |
| ROCm    | `ROCArray`     | `@roc`       |

#### Array Programming on the GPU {#sec-GPU-array}

First described in @sec-array-oriented-styles, array programming eschews writing loops and and instead favors initializing blocks of heap-allocated memory and filling it with data to be operated on at a single point in time. While this is often not the most efficient way to utilize CPUs, it's essentially the required style of code to utilize GPUs.

For the example below, we will calculate the present value of a series of cashflows across a number of different scenarios. An explanation of the code is given below the example.

```{julia}
using Metal

function calculate_present_values!(present_values,cashflows, discount_matrices) # <1>
    # Perform element-wise multiplication and sum along the time dimension
    present_values .= sum(cashflows .* discount_matrices, dims=1) # <2>   
end

# Example usage using 100 time periods, 100k scenarios
num_scenarios = 10^5
pvs = zeros(Float32,1,num_scenarios)
cashflows = rand(Float32, 100) # <3>
discount_matrices = rand(Float32, 100, num_scenarios)  # <4>

# copy the data to the GPU
pvs_GPU = MtlArray(pvs)
cashflows_GPU = MtlArray(cashflows) # <5>
discount_matrices_GPU = MtlArray(discount_matrices)

@btime calculate_present_values!($pvs,$cashflows, $discount_matrices)
@btime calculate_present_values!($pvs_GPU,$cashflows_GPU, $discount_matrices_GPU) # <6>
```

1.  The function `calculate_present_values!` is written the same way as if we were just writing CPU code. Note that we are also passing a pre-allocated vector, `present_values` to store the result. This will allow us to isolate the performance of the computation, rather than including any overhead of allocating the array for the result.
2.  The code is broadcasted across the first dimension so that the single set of cashflows is discounted for each scenario's discount vector.
3.  Metal only supports 32 bit floating point (some CUDA hardware will support 64 bit floating point)
4.  Using 100 thousand scenarios for this example.
5.  `MtlArray(array)` will copy the array values to the GPU.
6.  Note that the data still lives on the GPU and is of the `MtlMatrix` (a type alias for a 2-D `MtlArray`).

The testing suggests approximately 200 times faster computation when performed on the GPU. Note however, that does not include the overhead of (1) moving the data to the GPU (in the initial `MtlArray(cashflows)` call), or (2) returning the data to the CPU (since the return type for the GPU version is `MtlArray`). We can measure this overhead by wrapping the data transfer inside another function and benchmarking it:

```{julia}
function GPU_overhead_test(present_values, cashflows,discount_matrices)
    pvs_GPU = MtlArray(present_values)
    cashflows_GPU = MtlArray(cashflows) # <5>
    discount_matrices_GPU = MtlArray(discount_matrices)

    calculate_present_values!(pvs_GPU,cashflows_GPU, discount_matrices_GPU)

    Array(pvs_GPU) # convert to CPU array
end

@btime GPU_overhead_test($pvs,$cashflows,$discount_matrices)

```

With the additional overhead, the computation on the GPU takes more total time than if the work were done just on the CPU. This is a very simple example, and the balance tips heavily in favor of the GPU when:

1.  The computational demands are significantly higher (e.g. we were to do more calculations than just a simple multiply/divide/sum).
2.  The data size grows bigger.

::: callout-note
The previous example can be translated to CUDA by simply exchanging `MtlArray` for `CuArray`.

::: callout-warning
This example again underscores that hardware paralellization is not an automatic "win" for performance. A lot of uninformed discussion around modeling performance is to simply try to get things to run on the GPU and it is often *not* the case that the models will run faster. Further, as the modeling logic gets more complex, it does require greater care to keep in mind GPU constraints (acceptable data types, memory limitations, avoiding scalar operations, data transfer between CPU and GPU, etc.). A best practice is to contemplate sequential performance and memory usage before leveraging GPU accelerators.

#### Kernel Programming on the GPU

Another approach to GPU programing is often referred to as kernel programming, or being much more explicit about *how* a computation is performed. This is as opposed to the declarative approach in the array-oriented style (@sec-GPU-array) wherein we specified *what* we wanted the computation to be.

The key ideas here are that we need to manually specifiy several aspects which came 'free' in the array-oriented style. The tradeoff is that we can be more fine-tuned about how the computation leverages our hardware, potentially increasing performance. 

The GPU libraries in Julia abstract much of the low level programming typically necessary for this style of programming, but we still need to explicitly look at:

1. How the GPU will iterate across different cores/threads threads.
2. How many threads to utilize, the optimal number depends on the shape of the computation (long vectors, multi-dimensional arrays), memory constraints, and hardware specifics.
  - GPU threads: Individual units of execution within a kernel. Each thread runs the same kernel code but operates on a different portion of the data. 
3. How to chunk (group) the data to distribute the data to the different GPU threads

Our strategy for the present values example will be to distribute the work such that different GPU threads are working on different scenarios. Within a scenario, the loop is a very familiar approach: initialize a subtotal to zero and then accumulate the calculated present values.

```{julia}
function calculate_present_values_kernel!(present_values,cashflows, discount_matrices)
    idx = thread_position_in_grid_1d()  # <1>

    pv = 0.0f0 # <2>
    for t in 1:size(cashflows, 1)
        pv += cashflows[t] * discount_matrices[t, idx] # <3>
    end

    present_values[idx] = pv # <4>
    return nothing # <5>
end
```

1. As the work is distributed across threads, `thread_position_in_grid_1d()` will give the index of the current thread so that we can index data approporiately for the work as we decide to splitit up (we've split up thw work by scenario in this example).
2. Recall that we are working with `Float32` on the GPU here, so the zero value is set via the `f0` notation indicating a 32-bit floating point number.
3. The loop is across timesteps within each thread, while the thread index is tracked with `idx`.
4. The result is written to the pre-allocated array of present values, and we avoid race conditions because the different threads are working on difference scenarios.
5. We don't explicitly have to `return nothing` here, but it makes it extra clear that the intention of the function is to mutate the `present_values` array given to it. This mutation intention is also signaled by the `!` convention in the function name.

The kernel above was fairly similar to how we might write code for CPU-threaded approaches, but we now need to specify the technicals of launching this on the GPU. The `threads` defines how many independent calculations to run at a given time, and the maximum will be dependent on the hardware used. The `groups` argument defines the number of threads that share memory and synchronize results together (meaning that group will wait for all threads to finish before moving onto the next chunck of data). The push-pull here is that threads that can share data avoid needing to create duplicate copies of that data in memory, but if there is variability in how long each calculation will take, then the waiting time for synchronizing results may slow the overall computation down.

Our task utilizes shared memory of the cashflows for each thread, so through some experimentation in advance, we find that a relatively large group size of ~512 is optimal.

We bring this all together through the use of the kernel macro `@metal`:

```{julia}
threads = 1024
groups = cld(num_scenarios, 512)

@btime @metal threads=$threads groups=$groups calculate_present_values_kernel!(
    $pvs_GPU,
    $cashflows_GPU, 
    $discount_matrices_GPU
    )
```

This is approximately seven times faster than the array-oriented style above, meaning that the GPU kernel version's computation is over 1000 times faster than the CPU version. However, we saw previsouly that the cost of moving the data to the GPU memory and then back to the CPU memory was the biggest time sink of all - again we'd need to have more scale in the problem to make offloading to the GPU beneficial overall.

:::callout-note
The Metal GPUs are able to iterate threads across three different dimensions. In the prior example, we only used one dimension and thus used `thread_position_in_grid_1d()`. If we were distributing the threads across, say, three dimensions then we would use `thread_position_in_grid_2d()`. 

How do you determine how many dimensions to use? A good approach is to mimic the data you are trying to parallelize. In the example of calculating a vector of present values across 100k scenarios, that was the primary 'axis of parallelization'. If instead of a one-dimensional set of cashflows (e.g. a single asset with fixed cashflows), we had a two-dimensional set of cashflows (e.g. a portfolio of many assets), then we may find the best balance of code simplicity and performance to iterate across two dimensions of threads (but we are still limited by the same number of total available threads).
:::

:::callout-note
The above example would be translated to CUDA by changing just a few things:

- The thread indexing would be `idx = threadIdx().x` instead of `i = threadIdx().x`
- The GPU arrays should be created with `CuArray` instead of `MtlArray`.
- The kernel macro would be `@cuda threads=1024 calculate_present_values_kernel!(...)` instead of `@metal threads=threads groups=groups calculate_present_values_kernel(...)`. The memory sharing and synchronizing between threads is more manual than Metal.jl, but this is not strictly necessary for our example.

THIS CODE NEEDS TO BE TESTED ON A CUDA MACHINE:

```julia
function calculate_present_values_kernel!(present_values,cashflows, discount_matrices)
    idx = threadIdx().x 

    pv = 0.0f0
    for t in 1:size(cashflows, 1)
        pv += cashflows[t] * discount_matrices[t, idx]
    end

    present_values[idx] = pv
    return nothing
end

groups = cld(num_scenarios, 512)

@cuda threads=threads calculate_present_values_kernel!(
    pvs_GPU,
    cashflows_GPU, 
    discount_matrices_GPU
    )
```

## Multi-Processing / Multi-Device {#sec-multi-device}

Mutiple device, or **multi-device** computer refers to using separate groups of memory/processor combinations to accomplish tasks in parallel. This can be as simple as multiple distinct cores on within a single desktop computer, or many separate computers networked across the internet, or many processesors within a high performance cluster or a computing-as-a-service provider like Amazon Web Services or JuliaHub.

Everything discussed previously related to hardware (@sec-hardware, @sec-multithreading, @sec-GPUs) continues to apply. The additional complexity is attempting to syncronize the computation across multiple sets of the same (homogenous) or different (heterogenous) hardware.

As you might imagine, approaches to multi-device computing can vary widely. Julia's approach tries to strike the balance between capability and user-friendliness and uses a primary/worker model wherein one of the processors is the main coordinator while other processors are "workers". If only one processor is started, then the main processor is also a worker processor. This main/worker approach uses a "one-sided" approach to coordination. The main worker utilizes high level calls and the workers respond, with some of the communication and handoff handled by Julia transparently from the user's perspective.

A useful mental model is the asynchronous task-based concepts discussed in @sec-tasks, as the main worker will effectively queue up work with the worker processors. Because there may be a delay associated with the computation or the communication between the processors, the worker runs asynchronously.

| Description                   | Task API              | Distributed Analogue |
|-------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|
| Create a new task             | `Task()`             | `@spawnat`           |
| Run task asynchronously       | `@async`             | `@spawnat`           |
| Retrieve task result          | `fetch`              | `fetch`              |
| Wait for task completion      | `@sync`              | `sync`               |
| Communication between tasks   | `Channel`            | `RemoteChannel`      |

Adapting the trade producer and monitor example from above to run on multiple processors (see #sec-channels to review the base model and algorithm), we make a few key changes:

- `using Distributed` loads the Distributed standard Julia library, providing the interface for multi-processing across different hardware.
- `addprocs(n)` will add `n` worker processors (the main processor is already counted as one worker). When adding local machine processors, the processors are part of the local machine. This starts new Julia processes (you can see this in the task manager of the machine) which inherit the package environment (i.e. `Project.toml` and environment variables) from the main process; this does not occur automatically if not part of the same local machine.
  - To add processors from other machines, see the [Distributed Computing](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/Distributed/) section of the Julia docs.
- `myid()` is the identification number of the given processor that's been spun up.
- We use a `RemoteChannel` instead of a `Channel` to facilitate communication across processors.
- Instead of `@async`, we use `@spawnat n` to create a task for processor number `n` (or `:any` will automatically assign a processor).  

See 
```{julia}
using Distributed
let

# Add worker processes if not already added
if nworkers() == 1
    addprocs(4)  # Add 4 worker processes
end

@everywhere function trade_producer(channel, i)
    sleep(rand())
    profit = randn()
    put!(channel, profit)
    println("Producer $(myid()): Trade Result #$i $(round(profit, digits=3))")
end

@everywhere function portfolio_monitor(channel, n)
    sum = 0.0
    for _ in 1:n  # <3>
        profit = take!(channel)
        sum += profit
        println("Monitor $(myid()): Received $(round(profit, digits=3)), Cumulative profit: $(round(sum, digits=3))")
    end
end

function run_distributed_simulation()
    channel = RemoteChannel(() -> Channel{Float64}(32))  # <4>

    # Start producer and consumer tasks
    @sync begin  # <5>
        for i in 1:5
            @spawnat :any trade_producer(channel, i)  # <6>
        end
        @spawnat :any portfolio_monitor(channel, 5)  # <6>
    end

    # Close the channel and wait for tasks to finish
    close(channel)
end

# Run the simulation
run_distributed_simulation()
end
```

Given the similarity to the single-process version, what's the motivation for this approach? A few differences:

- In this simplified example, we are simply starting additional Julia processes on the same machine. Like a threaded approach, the work will be split across the same multi-core processor. In this context, the main difference is that the processes do not share memory. 
  - Communicating across processes generally has a little bit more overhead than communicating across threads.
- If distributing across machines, not sharing memory is advantageous if using multi-processing across machines that have their own memory stores which need not compete with the main process (such as distributing chunks of large datasets).
- The worker processors don't need to be the same architecture as the main processor, allowing usage of different machines or cloud computing that is communicating with a local main process.

## Parallel Programming Models {#sec-parallel-programming-models}

The previous sections have explained the different parallel programming models and how to directly utilize them to harness additional computing power. Each approach (multi-threading, GPU, distributed processing, etc.) has unique considerations and tradeoffs. These approaches in Julia are generally much more accessable to beginning and intermediate users than other languages, but admittedly still requires a decent amount of thought and care.

It is possible, if you are willing to give up some fine-grained control, to utilize some higher level approaches which look to abstract away some of the particularities of the implementation. 

### Map-Reduce

Map-Reduce (@sec-map-reduce) operations are inherently parallelizable and various libraries provide parallelized versions of the base `mapreduce`. This is the workhorse function of many 'big data' workloads and many statistical operations are versions of `mapreduce`. 

#### Multi-Threading

##### OhMyThreads

[ThreadsX.jl](https://github.com/JuliaFolds2/OhMyThreads.jl) provides the threaded versions of essential functions such as `tmap`, `tmapreduce`,`tcollect`, and `tforeach` (see @tbl-funcional-methods). In most cases, the chunking and data sharing is handled automatically for you.

```{julia}
import OhMyThreads
@btime OhMyThreads.tmapreduce(x -> x, +, 1:100_000)
```

##### ThreadsX

[ThreadsX.jl](https://github.com/JuliaFolds2/ThreadsX.jl) is built off of the wonderful [Transducers.jl](https://github.com/JuliaFolds2/Transducers.jl) package, though the latter is a bit more advanced (more abstract, but as a result more composable and powerful). ThreadsX provides threaded versions of many popular base functions. It offers a wider set of readymade threaded functions, but has a much more complex codebase. For the vast majority of threading needs, OhMyThreads.jl should be sufficent and performant. See the documentation for all of the implemented functions, but for our illustrative example:

```{julia}
import ThreadsX
@btime ThreadsX.mapreduce(x -> x, +, 1:100_000)
```

#### Multi-Processing

`reduce(op,pmap(f,collection))` will use a distributed map and reduce the resulting map on the main thread. This pattern works well if each application of `f` to elements of `collection` is costly. 

`@distributed (op) for x in collection; f(x); end` is a way to write the loop with the reduction `op` for which the `f` need not be costly. 

The difference between the two approaches is that with `pmap`, `collection` is made available to all workers. In the `@distributed` approach, the collection is partitioned and only a subset is sent to the designated workers. 

Here's an example of both of these, calculating a simple example of counting coin flips:

```{julia}
# this is a example of poor utilization of pmap, since the operation is 
# fast and the overhead of moving the whole collection dominates
@btime reduce(+,pmap(x -> rand((0,1)),1:10^3))
```

```{julia}
 
function dist_demo()
    @distributed (+) for _ in 1:10^5
        rand((0,1))
    end
end

@btime dist_demo()
```

### Array-Based

Array based approaches will often utilize the parallelism of SIMD on the CPU or many cores on the GPU. It's as simple as using generic library calls which will often be optimized at the compiler level. Examples:

```{julia}
let
    x = rand(Float32,10^8)
    x_GPU = MtlArray(x)
    @btime sum($x)
    @btime sum($x_GPU)
end
```

`sum(x)` compiles to SIMD instructions on the CPU, while using the GPU array type in `sum(x_GPU)` is enough to let the compiler dispatch on the GPU type and emit efficient, parallelized code for the GPU.

Distributed array types allow for large datasets to effectively be partitioned across mutliple processors, and have implementations in the [DistributedArrays.jl](https://juliaparallel.org/DistributedArrays.jl/stable/) and [Dagger.jl](https://juliaparallel.org/Dagger.jl/dev/darray/) libraries.

### Loop-Based

Loops which don't have race conditions can easily become multi-threaded. Here, we have three versions of updating a collection to square the contained values:

```{julia}
let v = collect(1:10000)

    for i in eachindex(v)
        v[i] = v[i]^2
    end
    v[1:3]
end
```

Using multi-threading
```{julia}
let v = collect(1:10000)
    Threads.@threads  for i in eachindex(v)
        v[i] = v[i]^2
    end
    v[1:3]
end
```

Using multi-processing:
```{julia}
let v = collect(1:10000)
    Distributed.@distributed for i in eachindex(v)
        v[i] = v[i]^2
    end
    v[1:3]
end
```

For more advanced usage, including handling shared memory see @sec-multi-device and @sec-multithreading.

### Task-Based

Task based approaches attempt to abstract the scheduling and distribution of work from the user. Instead of saying how the computation should be done, the user specifies the inteded operations and allows the library to handle the workflow. The main library for this in Julia is [Dagger.jl](https://juliaparallel.org/Dagger.jl/dev/darray/).

Effectively, the library establishes a network topology (a map of how different processor nodes can communicate) and models the work as a directed, acyclic graph (a DAG, which is like a map of how the work is related). The library is then able to assign the work in the appropriate order to the available computation devices. The benefit of this is most apparent with complex workflows or network topologies where it would be difficult to manually assign, communicate, and schedule the workflow. 

Here's a very simple example which demonstrates Dagger waiting for the two tasks which work in parallel (we already added multiple processors to this environment in @sec-multi-device):

```{julia}
import Dagger

# This runs first:
a = Dagger.@spawn rand(100, 100)

# These run in parallel:
b = Dagger.@spawn sum(a)
c = Dagger.@spawn prod(a)

# Finally, this runs:
wait(Dagger.@spawn println("b: ", b, ", c: ", c))
```
