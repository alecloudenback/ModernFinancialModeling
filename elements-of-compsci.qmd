# Elements of Computer Science

> “Fundamentally, computer science is a science of abstraction—creating the right model for a problem and devising the appropriate mechanizable techniques to solve it. Confronted with a problem, we must create an abstraction of that problem that can be represented and manipulated inside a computer. Through these manipulations, we try to find a solution to the original problem.” - Al Aho and Jeff Ullman (1992)

Adapting computer science concepts to work for financial professionals. Concepts like computability, computational complexity, the language of algorithms and problem solving, looking for and using patterns, and adopting digital-first practices to automate the boring parts of the job.

## Computer Science for Financial Professionals

Computer science as a term can be a bit misleading because of the overwhelming association with the physical desktop or laptop machines that we call "computers". The discipline of computer science is much richer than consumer electronics: at it's core, computer science concerns itself with areas of reserach and answering tough questions:

- **Algorithms and Optimization**. How can a problem be solved efficiently? How can that problem be solved *at all*? Given constraints, how can one find an optimal solution? 
- **Information Theory**. Given limited data, what *can* be known or inferred from it? 
- **Theory of Computation**. What sorts of questions are even answerable? Is an answer easy to computer or will resolving it require more resources than the entire known universe? Will a computation ever stop calculating?
- **Data Structures**. How to encode, store, and use data? How does that data relate to each other and what are the trade-offs between different representations of that data?

For a reader in the twenty-first century we hope that's it's patently obvious how impactful the *applied* computer science has been as an end-user of the internet, artificial intelligence, computational photography, safety control systems, etc., etc. have been to our lives. It is a testament to the utlity of being able to harness some of the ideas of this science is. Many of the most impactful advances occur at the boundary between two disciplines. It's here in this chapter that we desire to bring together the financial discipline together with computer science and to provide the financial practitioner with the language and concepts to leverage some of computer science's most relevant ideas.
