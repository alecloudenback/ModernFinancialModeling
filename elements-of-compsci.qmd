# Elements of Computer Science

> “Fundamentally, computer science is a science of abstraction—creating the right model for a problem and devising the appropriate mechanizable techniques to solve it. Confronted with a problem, we must create an abstraction of that problem that can be represented and manipulated inside a computer. Through these manipulations, we try to find a solution to the original problem.” - Al Aho and Jeff Ullman (1992)
