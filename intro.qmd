# Introduction

Part 1 of the book addresses the theoretical and technical foundations of programming, as well as the conceptual basis for financial modelling. It familiarizes the readers with key functional programming principles, alongside introducing important aspects of software engineering relevant to financial modelling.

Parts 2 and 3 bridge the gap between theory and practical applications, underlining the features of Julia that make it a robust tool for real-world financial and actuarial contexts. Through a careful exploration of topics like sensitivity analysis, optimization, stochastic modeling, visualization, and practical financial applications, the book demonstrates how Julia's high-level, high-performance programming capabilities can enhance accuracy and efficiency in financial modelling. As an up-and-coming language loved for its speed and simplicity, Julia is ripe for wide adoption in the financial sector. The time for this book is ripe, as it will satiate the growing demand for professionals who want to blend programming skills with financial modelling acumen.

The authors of the book are practicing actuaries, but we intend for the content to be applicable to nearly all practitioners in the financial industry. The discussion and examples may have an orientation towards insurance topics, but the concepts and patterns are applicable to a wide variety of related disciplines.
