# Introduction

> "I think one of the things that really separates us from the high primates is that we’re tool builders. I read a study that measured the efficiency of locomotion for various species on the planet. The condor used the least energy to move a kilometer. And, humans came in with a rather unimpressive showing, about a third of the way down the list. It was not too proud a showing for the crown of creation. So, that didn’t look so good. But, then somebody at Scientific American had the insight to test the efficiency of locomotion for a man on a bicycle. And, a man on a bicycle, a human on a bicycle, blew the condor away, completely off the top of the charts.

> And that’s what a computer is to me. What a computer is to me is it’s the most remarkable tool that we’ve ever come up with, and it’s the equivalent of a bicycle for our minds.” - Steve Jobs (1990)

The authors of the book are practicing actuaries, but we intend for the content to be applicable to nearly all practitioners in the financial industry. The discussion and examples may have an orientation towards insurance topics, but the concepts and patterns are applicable to a wide variety of related disciplines.

We will pull from examples on both sides of the balance sheet: the left (assets) and right (liabilities). We may also take the liberty to, at times, abuse traditional accounting notions: a liability is just an asset with the obligor and obligee switched. When the accounting conventions are important (such as modeling a total balance sheet) we will be mindful in explaining the accounting perspective. In practice, this means that we'll take examples that use examples of assets (fixed income, equity, derivatives) or liabilities (life insurance, annuities, long term care) and show that similar modeling techniques can be used for both. 

## What you will learn

It is our hope that with the help of this book, you will find it more efficient to discuss aspects of modeling with colleagues, borrow problem solving language from computer science, spot recurring structural patterns in problems that arise, and understand how best to make use of the "bicycle for your mind" in the context of financial modeling. 

It is the experience of the authors that many professsionals that do complex modeling as a part of their work have gotten to be very proficient *in spite of* not having substantive formal training on problem solving, algorithms, or model architecture. This book serves to fill that gap and provide the "missing semester" (or "years of practical learning"!). After reading this book, we hope that you will *appreciate* the attributes of Microsoft Excel that made it so ubiquitous, but that you *prefer* to use a programming language for the ability to more naturally express the relevant abstractions which make your models simpler, faster, or more usuable by others.

## The Contents of This Book

Part 1 of the book addresses the theoretical and technical foundations of programming, as well as the conceptual basis for financial modelling. It familiarizes the readers with key functional programming principles, alongside introducing important aspects of software engineering relevant to financial modelling.

Parts 2 and 3 bridge the gap between theory and practical applications, underlining the features of Julia that make it a robust tool for real-world financial and actuarial contexts. Through a careful exploration of topics like sensitivity analysis, optimization, stochastic modeling, visualization, and practical financial applications, the book demonstrates how Julia's high-level, high-performance programming capabilities can enhance accuracy and efficiency in financial modelling. As an up-and-coming language loved for its speed and simplicity, Julia is ripe for wide adoption in the financial sector. The time for this book is ripe, as it will satiate the growing demand for professionals who want to blend programming skills with financial modelling acumen.

While we have chosen to use Julia for the examples in this book, the vast majority of the concepts presented are not Julia-specific. We will attempt to motivate why Julia works so well as a language for financial modeling but like mathematics and applied mathematics, the concepts are portable even if the numbers (language) changes. Readers are encouraged to follow along the examples on their own computer (see instructions for Julia in @sec-julia-basics) and the entire book is available on GitHub at [#TODO: determine book URL].
