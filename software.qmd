## In this section

We describe modern software engineering practices such as version control, testing, documentation, and pipelines which can be utlizied by the financial professional to make their own work more robust and automated. Data practices and workflow advice.

## Introduction

In addition to the core concepts from computer science described so far, there's also a similar set of ideas about the *practice* and *experience* of working with a code-based workflow that makes the approach more powerful than what the code itself can do. 

That is, the majority of a professional finanical modeler's time is often spent *doing things other than building models*, such as testing the model's results, writing documentation, collaborating with others on the design, and figuring out how to share the model with others inside the company. This chapter covers how a code-first workflow makes each one of those responsibilities easier or more effective.
