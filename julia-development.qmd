# Developing In Julia

Aside from the essentials necessary to convey the topics, the prior chapters have provided relatively limited insight into the *workflow* of developing in Julia. An analogy is that we have, up to this point, talked about using hammers and saws to create widgets. And some advanced topics like how to make a widget run faster and smoother in different machines. This section of the book talks about the *process* of building and designing widgets, helping you to make your widget making factory run smoothly.

This chapter is heavy with Julia-specific tips and advice. We have deliberately delayed this content until well into the book, focusing on the concepts instead of getting bogged down on language-specific details. In this section, we dive into the 'messy' business of building bigger, integrated things and tools to make that easier. Readers taking the concepts to other languages need not burden themselves with the details of Julia workflows and therefore can jump to the section beginning with @sec-stochastic-mortality.

The chapters in this section are adapted from [Modern Julia Workflows](https://modernjuliaworkflows.org), originally written by G. Dalle, J. Smit, A. Hill. These chapters are a derivative of that work, and is also licensed CC BY-SA 4.0. 

The content was modified to fit the other content of this book (adding cross-references, removing duplicated content) and to add/subtract elements that the authors of this book deemed more appropriate for the financial modeler.
