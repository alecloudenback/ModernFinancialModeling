# Developing In Julia

Aside from the essentials necessary to convey the topics, the prior chapters have provided relatively limited insight into the *workflow* of developing in Julia. An analogy is that we have, up to this point, talked about using hammers and saws to create widgets. And some advanced topics like how to make a widget run faster and smoother in different machines. This section of the book talks about the *process* of building and designing widgets, helping you to make your widget making factory run smoothly.

This chapter is heavy with Julia-specific tips and advice. We have deliberately delayed this content until well into the book, letting the clarity of Julia code and concepts be the focus, not the 'messy' business of building bigger models. that those taking the concepts to other languages need not burden themselves with the details of Julia workflow and setup and can jump to the section beginning with @sec-software-principles.
