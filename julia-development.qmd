# Developing in Julia

Aside from the essentials needed to convey the topics, the previous chapters have provided relatively limited insight into the workflow of developing in Julia. Extending our earlier analogy: up to this point we have discussed using hammers and saws to create widgets, and even how to make a widget run faster and more smoothly on different machines. This chapter turns to the process of building and designing larger systems—the practices that make your widget‑making factory run smoothly.

This chapter is heavy with Julia-specific tips and advice. We have deliberately delayed this content until well into the book, focusing on the concepts instead of getting bogged down on language-specific details. In this section, we dive into the messy business of building bigger, integrated things and tools to make that easier. Readers taking the concepts to other languages need not burden themselves with the details of Julia workflows and therefore can jump to the section beginning with @sec-stochastic-mortality.

The chapters in this section are adapted from [Modern Julia Workflows](https://modernjuliaworkflows.org), originally written by G. Dalle, J. Smit, and A. Hill. These chapters derive from that work and are also licensed under CC BY‑SA 4.0.

The content has been modified to align with the rest of this book (e.g., adding cross‑references and removing duplicated material) and to add or remove elements that the authors deemed more appropriate for financial modelers.
